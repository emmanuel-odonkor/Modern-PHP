# Modern-PHP

These files implements and explains the idea of classes,traits, namespaces and the idea of autoloads.

The src folder contains the classes which are autoloaded into index.php. The index.php executes the methods of the Student, Calculator class, and the Trait Teacher.

The classes:
1. Student.php
2.Calculator.php
3.Teacher(Trait)



The autoloads was automatically configured with COMPOSER, a PHP dependency manager on the command line.
